<h2>About</h2>

<p>I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign. As a freshman, I'm taking CS 125, an in-depth introduction to
the world of comptuer science; I can't wait to get into the higher-level
courses (I'm looking at you, 225!).</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>I've been using computers for as long as I can remember, and I've developed my
passion for computer science over the past four years through my experiences
on the software subteam of [my school's FIRST Robotics team](http://wildstang.org/).
During my years on the team, I gained valuable experience in C/C++, Java,
Android, networking, and embedded systems. I had the opportunity to work with
many talented adult mentors and students, and also to mentor younger students
as I grew more knowledgeable.</p>

<p>I'm an active contributor to [The Blue Alliance](http://www.thebluealliance.com),
an open-source project that hosts information about FIRST Robotics events, teams,
and more. I've worked extensively on their
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thebluealliance.androidclient),
which had over 8,000 users during the 2015 competition season.</p>

<p>One of the largest projects I've worked on was a scouting system for my robotics
team. At competitions, most teams collect data on other teams in a process
called "scouting". The most popular way to do this is to collect data on paper
sheets that must later be entered into a spreadsheet. However, my team
identified this process as very inefficient and sought a better solution.</p>

<p>Working with the scouting subteam and several other students, I led the
development of an electronic scouting system that we called
[WildRank](https://github.com/nwalters512/wildrank-android-v2). It utilized
Android tablets for data collection, a desktop app for compiling the data in a
spreadsheet, and a flash drive to shuttle data around (wireless networking is
not allowed at competitions). Over the course of two years, we were able to
dramatically improve the speed of data collection and analysis. Ultimately, we
eleminated the spreadsheet entirely and merged that functionality into a single
Android app that could handle data collection, viewing, and analysis. The entire
system was open-sourced to the FIRST community and was
[very well received](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=129763)
by other teams.</p>

<h2>Fun facts</h2>
<ul class="mdi-ul">
    <li><i class="mdi mdi-li mdi-earth"></i>
        <p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to travel abroad to London, Paris, Tokyo, Kyoto, and other areas of Japan. This experience has given me a new perspective as a global citizen and has inspired in me a love of international travel and exploration. I can't wait for my next opportunity to explore the globe!</p>

        <p>I'm a recreational tennis player; hitting a ball around is a great way to spend time with friends and stay fit.</p>
    </li>
    <li><i class="mdi mdi-li mdi-music-note"></i>
        <p>I played the alto sax in my high school's concert, symphonic, and marching bands for four years. I'm hoping to continue playing for many years to come!</p>
