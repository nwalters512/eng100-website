            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. As a freshman, I'm taking CS 125, an in-depth introducting into the world of comptuer science; I can't wait to get into the higher-level courses (I'm looking at you, 225!).</p>
            <h5>Experience</h5>
            <p>I've been using computers for as long as I can remember, and I've been interested particularly in computer science for about four years. I don't have much formal experience with computer science; most of my knowledge comes from my experiences on the software subteam of <a href="http://wildstang.org/">my school's FIRST Robotics team</a>. During my years on the team, I had the opportunity to work with many talented students and adult mentors. I gained valuable experience in C/C++, Java, Android, networking, embedded systems, and more.</p>
            <p>I'm an active contributor to <a href="http://www.thebluealliance.com">The Blue Alliance</a>, an open-source project that hosts information about FIRST Robotics events, teams, and more. I've worked extensively on their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thebluealliance.androidclient&hl=en">Android app</a>, which had over 8,000 users during the 2015 competition season.</p>

                    <p>This past summer, I had the opportunity to travel abroad with my uncles; over the course of three weeks, I saw London, Paris, and Japan. This experience inspired in me a love of international travel, and I can't wait for my next opportunity to explore the globe!</p>

                <li><i class="mdi mdi-li mdi-tennis"></i>
                    <p>I'm a recreational tennis player; even though I'm not that good, hitting around a ball with some friends is a great way to pass the time.</p>

                <li><i class="mdi mdi-li mdi-music-note"></i>
                    <p>I was involved in my high school's band program for four years. I played the alto sax in the concert, symphonic, and marching bands.</p>
